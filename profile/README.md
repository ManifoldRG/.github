## About Manifold
Manifold is a new kind of research organization conducting large-scale, moonshot foundational and applied science and technology research. We select research directions based on their potential for real world impact, not solely academic output. Notably, we work in a hyper concentrated and network driven way.

## Our Research Directions
### Multimodality
We are developing and testing new model architectures & network primitives to achieve massively multimodal, “Generalist” systems capable of doing useful things across images, natural language, and the physical and digital world.
Active projects include:
- [Multinet](https://github.com/ManifoldRG/MultiNet)
### Metacognition
Metacognition helps agents evaluate and improve their decisions—critical for autonomy. Inspired by human cognition, we aim to benchmark and eventually build metacognitive abilities in these agents.
Active projects include:
- [Metacognition](https://discord.com/channels/755517485096108153/1262117499999092837)
### Swarm Intelligence
We’re exploring ways to enable swarms of robots to cooperate in a decentralized way, with an emphasis on real-time adaptation to out-of-distribution changes to their environments or scenarios. Active projects include:
- [Modular Space System Assembly](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSqxnRm_PUTHqY470JBBOd80_Qy5w6UmA_zJ4mMfpDaio6uIr1IpJM5G1kFzZPWGBO680xMpgLNaFJ/pub)
### Generative Biology
We’re exploring the application of foundation class models to biological problems, including drug discovery, feature detection, protein mapping, and more. Currently in an exploratory capacity, stay tuned for project details. Follow our progress on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/755517485096108153/1271231342931345520?ref=manifoldrg.com)!
